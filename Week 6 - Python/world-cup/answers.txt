Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I did not expect the ramp up to be as aggressive from 10,000 to 100,000

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call 100,000 to be good enough, with 10,000 simulations to be second place. The margin of error between 100,000 and 1,000,000 is too little to be worth 6x the expense, but the time cost going from 10,000 to 100,000 is also significant
